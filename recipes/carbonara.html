        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>100g pancetta</li>
            <li>50g pecorino cheese</li>
            <li>50g parmesan</li>
            <li>3 large eggs</li>
            <li>350g spaghetti</li>
            <li>2 plump garlic cloves, peeled and left whole</li>
            <li>50g unsalted butter</li>
            <li>sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Step 1</li>
            <p>Put a large saucepan of water on to boil.</p>
            <li>Step 2</li>
            <p>Finely chop the 100g pancetta, having first removed any rind. Finely grate 50g pecorino cheese and 50g
                parmesan and mix them together.</p>

            <li>Step 3</li>
            <p>Beat the 3 large eggs in a medium bowl and season with a little freshly grated black pepper. Set
                everything
                aside.</p>
            <li>Step 4</li>
            <p>Add 1 tsp salt to the boiling water, add 350g spaghetti and when the water comes back to the boil, cook
                at a
                constant simmer, covered, for 10 minutes or until al dente (just cooked).</p>
            <li>Step 5</li>
            <p>Squash 2 peeled plump garlic cloves with the blade of a knife, just to bruise it.</p>
            <li>Step 6</li>
            <p>While the spaghetti is cooking, fry the pancetta with the garlic. Drop 50g unsalted butter into a large
                frying pan or wok and, as soon as the butter has melted, tip in the pancetta and garlic.</p>
            <li>Step 7</li>
            <p>Leave to cook on a medium heat for about 5 minutes, stirring often, until the pancetta is golden and
                crisp.
                The garlic has now imparted its flavour, so take it out with a slotted spoon and discard.</p>
            <li>Step 8</li>
            <p>Keep the heat under the pancetta on low. When the pasta is ready, lift it from the water with a pasta
                fork or
                tongs and put it in the frying pan with the pancetta. Don't worry if a little water drops in the pan as
                well
                (you want this to happen) and don't throw the pasta water away yet.</p>
            <li>Step 9</li>
            <p>Mix most of the cheese in with the eggs, keeping a small handful back for sprinkling over later.</p>
            <li>Step 10</li>
            <p>Take the pan of spaghetti and pancetta off the heat. Now quickly pour in the eggs and cheese. Using the
                tongs or a long fork, lift up the spaghetti so it mixes easily with the egg mixture, which thickens but
                doesnâ€™t scramble, and everything is coated.</p>
            <li>Step 11</li>
            <p>Add extra pasta cooking water to keep it saucy (several tablespoons should do it). You don't want it wet,
                just moist. Season with a little salt, if needed.</p>
            <li>Step 12</li>
            <p>Use a long-pronged fork to twist the pasta on to the serving plate or bowl. Serve immediately with a
                little sprinkling of the remaining cheese and a grating of black pepper. If the dish does get a little
                dry before serving, splash in some more hot pasta water and the glossy sauciness will be revived.</p>
